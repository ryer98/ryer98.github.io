<h2>My Philosophy of Life</h2>
<p>I believe in finding your talent in life and utilizing it to your best ability.
  I believe we should work to serve our fellow man and God.
  I try to treat others as I would like to be treated.</p>
<h2>Why I came to West Point...</h2>
<p>I came to West Point because I want to have the best opportunity to make a difference.
  I believe it would provide the greatest way for me to better myself.
  It would provide an outlet for me to use my talents and become successful.</p>

<h2>My Mentor</h2>
<p> My mentor is my mom, Tabby Barnes.
  The most important thing I learned from her is that I should live my life by constantly working to improve yourself.
  What I learned from her has helped me to get to where I am here at West Point.</p>
<h2>Cadet Basic Training</h2>
<p> My favorite memory from CBT was when we learned about Land Navigation. I learned all about how to use compasses
  and azimuths. I really liked when we were told to walk through the woods and find coordinates on our own with only a map and compass.</p>
<h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
<p> My largest challenge I have faced so far as a cadet has been homesickness. I have never been apart from my family
  or loved ones before this. Beast was horrible for me and my whole life was writing letters to my family. I now enjoy facetiming those I love whenever
  I miss them.</p>
